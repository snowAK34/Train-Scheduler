# Train-Scheduler

## Description

A basic train schedule table with from to add additional data.

## Usage

This app was built to exercise use of Firebase database for data persistance.
Data for the table loads from the database, and form submission adds data to Firebase.

## Roadmap

Some style would be nice to add to the page.

It would be useful to add a button for each train to give the option to remove it from the table (and database).
